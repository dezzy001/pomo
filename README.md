* A web app utilising the pomodoro technique, attempting to gamify the process to make studying FUN like never before!

### Rules
#### 3 different modes:

* Easy (recommended)
  * One pomodoro cycle = 15 minutues study -> 5 minute breaks
  * after 2 cycles a 30 minute break is rewarded
  * If one cycle is broken, reduce 5 minutes to the 30 minutes break (additive)
  * 40 minute time commitment
  * 5 pomodoro cycles a day to complete the day
* Medium
  *  One pomodoro cycle = 20 minutues study -> 5 minute breaks
  * after 2 cycles a 30 minute break is rewarded
  * If one cycle is broken, reduce 5 minutes to the 30 minutes break (additive)
  * 50 minute time commitment
  * 5 pomodoro cycles a day to complete the day
* Hard
  * One pomodoro cycle = 25 minutues study -> 5 minute breaks
  * after 2 cycles a 30 minute break is rewarded
  * If one cycle is broken, reduce 5 minutes to the 30 minutes break (additive)
  * 60 minute time commitment
  * 5 pomodoro cycles a day to complete the day
